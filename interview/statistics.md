## Big Number & Central Limit Theorem

If we sample from a population using a sufficiently large sample size, the **mean of the samples will be normally distributed**, the **mean tending to the mean of the population** and  the **variance equal to the variance of the population divided by the size** of the sampleing **regardless of the distribution of the original population**.
