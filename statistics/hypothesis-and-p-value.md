# Hypothesis and P-value



## Steps of Hypothesis:

1. Design Hypothesis, H0 and H1.
2. Determine which test to be used? Z-test, t-test, F-test
3. Compute test score, one tail or two tails
4. P-value, alpha
5. Theoretical conclusion

## **P-value**

When we execute a **hypothesis test** in statistics, P-value is used to **determine the significance** of results after a hypothesis test in statistics. 

P-value helps the readers to draw conclusions and is always between 0 and 1.

* P- Value &gt; alpha \(e.g., 0.05\) denotes weak evidence against the null hypothesis which means the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
* P-value &lt;=  alpha\(e.g., 0.05\) denotes strong evidence against the null hypothesis which means the null hypothesis can be rejected.
